# About me

## Irene Sanz - Programmer on it's way

My name is **Irene**, I'm 28, and I am currently studying a higher degree in **Web Application Development** in Zaragoza.

At the same time, I also work in a small company, **Oshito**, dedicated to the development and design of web pages and audiovisual production.

It is at Oshito that I started doing small programming tasks, starting with HTML and CSS and moving on to PHP and JavaScript.
That's why I decided to study the degree, to be able to dedicate myself exclusively to programming, if possible Front-End.

Before that, I studied Marketing and Market Research at the University of Zaragoza.

But what I like the most is programming and web page design and I would love to be able to work and make a living doing it.
